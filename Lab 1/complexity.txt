7 Seventh:The choice of algorithm was chosen because it fulfilled the demands of storing the open parentheses.The time complexity of the 7 Seventh part is O(n) since it iterates every character only once.The memory complexity of the 7 Seventh parts is also O(n). The program only pushes the open parentheses to the stack and does not store the closed parentheses in any particular way. This results in n * 1/2 since only half of the characters are stored. The constants when calculating complexity are overlooked which in turn leads to a memory complexity of O(n).
